Topic: Predicting Covid-19 related mortality rate in countries based on demographic and dietary factors.  
This combines multiple datasets on nutrition with a dataset on demographic information as independent/input variables.
Outcome/dependent variable is mortality rate (deaths from Covid-19 / total confirmed cases)

**
Approaches Rafa suggest we explore**:
PCA - Principle component analysis

Shapely value regression - to handle multicollinearity in the features

Dimension reduction techniques such as RFE below
Recursive feature elimination - to remove features rather than do it manually
